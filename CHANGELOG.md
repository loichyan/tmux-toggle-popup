  window when switching to another popup ([#21]).

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-21

We've implemented several improvements to make it easier for other programs to
integrate with this plugin ([#5], [#9], thanks [@cenk1cenk2]). You can now
override popup global options on the fly using the newly added arguments of `@popup-toggle`.

### Added

- Support autostart popup server ([13bb98a]).
- Set an env variable to identify popup servers ([d95d654]).
- Support bind additional toggle keys in popups ([#9]).
- Support override global options through `@popup-toggle` ([#5]).

### Changed

- (**breaking**) Use xargs(1) and printf(1) to parse tmux commands ([#8]). This
  allows you to input `;` directly as the command delimiter without worrying
  about Bash's interpretation. The new parser may yield results that differ from
  the previous version, although this is usually not the case.

### Fixed

- Always retrieve option values from global ([61789c7]).
- Address the breaking changes in `display-popup` introduced in tmux versions
  3.5 and 3.5a ([#14]).

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Add two new hooks: `@popup-before-open` and `@popup-after-close` ([#2]).
- Add `@popup-focus`, primarily used as a workaround of [tmux/tmux#3991] ([#3]).
- Support close a popup if no argument passed to `@popup-toggle` ([5ef9ea4]).

### Changed

- (**breaking**) Use bash(1) to parse tmux commands, thus semicolons in hooks
  (`@popup-on-open` and `@popup-on-close`) must now be explicitly escaped or
  quoted ([#1]).
- (**breaking**) Rename `@popup-on-open` to `@popup-on-init` ([#2]).

### Removed

- (**breaking**) Remove `@popup-on-close`, as it cannot handle popup exits.
  Instead, consider setting the `client-detached` and `pane-exited` tmux hooks
  in `@popup-on-init` ([#2]).

### Fixed

- Hide messages of tmux commands in popups ([5eb66cd]).
