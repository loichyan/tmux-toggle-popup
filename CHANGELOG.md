## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.4] - 2025-08-30

This release doesn't include major updates but fixes a bug that occurred when
using multiple popups specified with `--id`.

### Fixed

- Resolve name conflicts when using `--id` ([#52])

[#52]: https://github.com/loichyan/tmux-toggle-popup/pull/52

## [0.4.3] - 2025-08-14

This release resolves a long-standing issue with `@popup-toggle` on macOS's
ancient built-in Bash ([#44]). Thanks to [u/Beautiful_Baseball76] for the
feedback , which also motivated me to add a number of integration tests,
although many are powered by some "dark" Bash magic =.=

### Added

- Distribute this plugin to nixpkgs ([#42], [NixOS/nixpkgs#428294], thanks
  [@szaffarano])
- Support specifying the socket path for the popup server ([#43])

### Changed

- The `before-open` and `after-close` hooks are called in the same execution
  that opens the popup window. This should rarely have side effects ([#46])

### Fixed

- Support macOS's ancient built-in Bash ([#44])
- Forward all arguments when setting specified toggle keys ([#45])

## [0.4.2] - 2025-07-29

This release comes with a few noticeable performance improvements for
`@popup-toggle`. Thanks to the techniques introduced in [#33], the latency of
popup toggles has been reduced by 40% to 60% on average.

### Added

- Support using `{popup_caller_path}` and `{popup_caller_pane_path}` to open
  popups ([#35])
- Support using `nop` to disable a hook explicitly ([#36])

### Changed

- Reduce the lantency of popup toggles by up to 60% ([#33], [#34])

[#36]: https://github.com/loichyan/tmux-toggle-popup/pull/36

## [0.4.1] - 2025-05-07

### Added

- Add a new argument, `@popup-toggle --id <id>`, to directly set the ID of a
  popup, useful for creating globally shared popups ([#27])

### Fixed

- Replace special characters in the popup ID to ensure `@popup-toggle` does not
  fail if the current directory contains dots (`.`) or colons (`:`) ([#29])
- Forward working directory to popup sessions to ensure `@popup-toggle -d <dir>`
  functions properly in switch mode ([#30])
- Forward current popup's ID format in switch mode to ensure the intended popup
  is opened when switching ([#31])

## [0.4.0] - 2024-11-23

### Added

- Add a new toggle mode, `switch`, which always reuses the currently opened
  window when switching to another popup ([#21])

### Changed

- (**breaking**) Replace `@popup-toggle --force` with
  `--toggle-mode=force-close` ([#21])
- (**breaking**) Replace tmux variable `#{@popup_name}` in `@popup-id-format`
  with the `{popup_name}` placeholder ([#21])

### Fixed

- Disable potential tmux messages from popups ([#23])

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-21

We've implemented several improvements to make it easier for other programs to
integrate with this plugin ([#5], [#9], thanks [@cenk1cenk2]). You can now
override popup global options on the fly using the newly added arguments of
`@popup-toggle`.

### Added

- Support autostart popup server ([13bb98a])
- Set an env variable to identify popup servers ([d95d654])
- Support bind additional toggle keys in popups ([#9])
- Support override global options through `@popup-toggle` ([#5])

### Changed

- (**breaking**) Use xargs(1) and printf(1) to parse tmux commands ([#8]). This
  allows you to input `;` directly as the command delimiter without worrying
  about Bash's interpretation. The new parser may yield results that differ from
  the previous version, although this is usually not the case.

### Fixed

- Always retrieve option values from global ([61789c7])
- Address the breaking changes in `display-popup` introduced in tmux versions
  3.5 and 3.5a ([#14])

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- Add two new hooks: `@popup-before-open` and `@popup-after-close` ([#2])
- Add `@popup-focus`, primarily used as a workaround of [tmux/tmux#3991] ([#3])
- Support close a popup if no argument passed to `@popup-toggle` ([5ef9ea4])

### Changed

- (**breaking**) Use bash(1) to parse tmux commands, thus semicolons in hooks
  (`@popup-on-open` and `@popup-on-close`) must now be explicitly escaped or
  quoted ([#1])
- (**breaking**) Rename `@popup-on-open` to `@popup-on-init` ([#2])

### Removed

- (**breaking**) Remove `@popup-on-close`, as it cannot handle popup exits.
  Instead, consider setting the `client-detached` and `pane-exited` tmux hooks
  in `@popup-on-init`. ([#2])

### Fixed

- Hide messages of tmux commands in popups ([5eb66cd])
